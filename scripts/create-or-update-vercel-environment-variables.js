/**
 * Creates or updates environment variables in Vercel.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Values are read from the current environment. The project ID and Vercel access
 * token are also read from the current environment. This script is intended to
 * be executed in a Github actions workflow in which these environment variables
 * have been initialized with values read from Github secrets and environment
 * variables.
 *
 * Environment variables that are not prefixed with "NEXT_PUBLIC_" are marked
 * sensitive in Vercel, meaning that they cannot be viewed in the Vercel
 * dashboard.
 *
 * This script is required because, although the project is built in GH actions
 * and then deployed to Vercel, the application must access environment
 * variables at runtime. Therefore, the same environment variables accessed
 * at build time must be made available to the deployed app.
